# ML-Engineering-Foundation 🚀

This repository documents my journey through the Stanford Machine Learning Specialization. It contains clean implementations of core algorithms, moving from basic regression to advanced neural networks.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
### Week 1: Linear Regression with One Variable
- **Cost Function:** Implemented Mean Squared Error (MSE) to measure model accuracy.
- **Gradient Descent:** Applied batch gradient descent to minimize the cost function $J(w,b)$.
- **Optimization:** Deep understanding of learning rates ($\alpha$) and simultaneous parameter updates.
- **Math:** Verified the convexity of the squared error cost function (Global Minimum).

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Target Hardware:** Mac Studio M4 Max (Optimized for high-performance computing)

## 📈 Roadmap
- [x] Week 1: Simple Linear Regression
- [ ] Week 2: Multiple Linear Regression & Vectorization
- [ ] Week 3: Logistic Regression & Regularization
